# iDialogPad

This is an EMA (ecological momentary assessment) and general questionaire universal app for IOS.
It has been in use since the first IOS release by many research groups and been distributed by adhoc in the past.
Now that XCODE7 provides sideloading apps i decided to put the project to github so that everybody can use it for free.

The uVariotest editor and simulator programms are also added. (Mac and PC) 

The script "sort_qdf" can be used to sort unsorted idialogpad outputs offline.
